# Issue: Click v8.2+ Compatibility - Breaking Changes with `mix_stderr` Parameter

## Summary
The CLI test suite fails with Python 3.11 + Click 8.2+ due to breaking changes in Click's `CliRunner` class, specifically the removal of the `mix_stderr` parameter. This parameter was used extensively in our test suite to control how stdout and stderr are handled in test outputs.

## Background
In our test suite, we use `CliRunner(mix_stderr=False)` to separate stdout and stderr outputs in test results. Many tests rely on this behavior when verifying output patterns and error messages. With Click 8.2+, this parameter has been completely removed, causing test failures.

## Error Details
When running tests with Python 3.11 (which uses Click 8.2+), we get the following error:

```
TypeError: CliRunner.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'mix_stderr'
======================================================================
ERROR [0.002s]: test_record_test (tests.test_runners.test_robot.RobotTest.test_record_test)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/runner/.local/share/virtualenvs/cli-uK8bV6hy/lib/python3.11/site-packages/responses/__init__.py", line 232, in wrapper
```

## Changes in Click 8.2+
According to the [Click GitHub Issues](https://github.com/pallets/click/issues/2522) and [Pull Request](https://github.com/pallets/click/pull/2523):

1. **Before Click 8.2**:
   - `CliRunner` had a `mix_stderr` parameter
   - `mix_stderr=True` (default): stdout and stderr mixed in `result.stdout` and `result.output`
   - `mix_stderr=False`: stdout in `result.stdout`, stderr in `result.stderr`

2. **After Click 8.2**:
   - The `mix_stderr` parameter has been completely removed
   - Results **always** provide separate stdout and stderr access:
     - `result.stdout`: Contains only stdout
     - `result.stderr`: Contains only stderr
     - `result.output`: Combined output (similar to what a user would see in a terminal)

## Impact on Our Tests
Several test cases fail because they expect error messages to be in `result.stdout` when `mix_stderr=False` is specified, but with Click 8.2+ these messages are now in `result.stderr`.

Affected test files include:
- `tests/commands/test_subset.py`
- `tests/test_runners/test_raw.py`
- And potentially others that rely on the `mix_stderr` behavior

## Dependency Configuration
Our current dependency configuration in `setup.cfg` specifies:
```
install_requires =
    click>=8.0,<8.1;python_version=='3.6'
    click>=8.1,<8.2;python_version>'3.6'
```

This means we're trying to use Click < 8.2, but when running with Python 3.11 in CI environments, Click 8.2+ is being installed, causing these compatibility issues.

## Potential Solutions
1. **Modify test cases** to check both `stdout` and `stderr` for expected messages
2. **Create a compatibility wrapper** for `CliRunner` that emulates the old behavior
3. **Conditionally set parameters** based on the Click version
4. **Update dependency constraints** to explicitly limit Click version to < 8.2 for all Python versions

## Next Steps
We need to decide on the best approach to maintain compatibility with both older Click versions and Click 8.2+, while minimizing code changes and maintaining test clarity.
